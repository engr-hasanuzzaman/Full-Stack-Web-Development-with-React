// declaring function type both params & return are required but
// during function implementation return type is optional as typscript can guess
// return type by return statement

// Number of param have to be matched (in js this does not required)
// In JavaScript, every parameter is optional, and users may leave them off as they see fit.

// It is not possible to pass null to defaut parameter

// f a default-initialized parameter comes before a required parameter, users need to explicitly pass undefined to get the default initialized value.
